      Working out is intentional physical activity to enhance or maintain
      fitness and overall health. It is performed for various reasons, including
      weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop
      muscles and the cardiovascular system. Many individuals choose to
      excersize outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize and
      improve well-being.

      A game is a structured type of play, usually undertaken for entertainment
      or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Many games are also
      considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or
      games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic
      layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
